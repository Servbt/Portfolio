# Portfolio (WIP)

## This page is currently under development

So far I've added in proprietary code and included snippets from my previous portfolio to fill the space that will eventually contain a real portfolio.
In my todo list currently includes:
  > Fleshing out the conditionals,
  > Proper implementation of react routers,
  > Further styling through bootstrap,
  > Inclusion of actual technologies learned,
  > More thorough contact page,
  > Making an actual bio page relating to what I've learned.
